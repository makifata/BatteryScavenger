# BatteryScavenger
Hardware to extract last drip of energy from old batteries.

# Thoughts
* NiMH as an energy bank due to small self-discharging
* TPS6120X for low cost BOM to boost 0.3 to 5V.
* BQ25172 as NiMH battery charger
* INA180 for measuring charging current.
* Low Ron FETs?
* Microcontroller (STM32L0) to manage total energy saved.
